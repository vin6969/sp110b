## General-Purpose Registers (GPR)

The 8 GPRs are as follows:
* Accumulator register (AX). Used in arithmetic operations
* Counter register (CX). Used in shift/rotate instructions and loops.
* Data register (DX). Used in arithmetic operations and I/O operations.
* Base register (BX). Used as a pointer to data (located in segment register DS, when in segmented mode).
* Stack Pointer register (SP). Pointer to the top of the stack.
* Stack Base Pointer register (BP). Used to point to the base of the stack.
* Source Index register (SI). Used as a pointer to a source in stream operations.
* Destination Index register (DI). Used as a pointer to a destination in stream operations.
